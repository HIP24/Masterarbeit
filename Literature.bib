  abstract = {This work investigates the real-time performance of Linux kernels and distributions with a PREEMPT\_RT real-time patch on ARM-based embedded devices. Experimental measurements, which are mainly based on heuristic methods, provide novel insights into Linux real-time performance on ARM-based embedded devices (e.g., BeagleBoard and RaspberryPi). Evaluations of the Linux real-time performance are based on specific real-time software measurement modules, developed for this purpose, and the use of a standard benchmark tool, cyclictest. Software modules were designed upon the introduction of a new response task model, an innovative aspect of this work. Measurements include the latency of response tasks at user and kernel space, the response on the execution of periodic tasks, the maximum sustained frequency and general latency performance metrics. The results show that in such systems the PREEMPT\_RT patch provides more improved real-time performance than the default Linux kernels. The latencies and particularly the worst-case latencies are reduced with real-time support, thus making such devices running Linux with PREEMPT\_RT more appropriate for use in time-sensitive embedded control systems and applications. Furthermore, the proposed performance measurements approach and evaluation methodology could be applied and deployed on other Linux-based real-time platforms.},

The experimental measurements of the Linux real-time performance on these devices are based on real-time software modules developed specifically for the purposes of this research. Taking in consideration the constraints of the specific hardware platforms under investigation, new measurements software was developed.

The reduced worst-case latencies on such devices running Linux with real-time support could make them potentially more suitable for real-time applications as long as a latency value of about 160 {\textmu}s, as an upper bound, is an acceptable safety margin.},

  abstract = {Linux has become a viable operating system for many real-time workloads. However, the black-box approach adopted by cyclictest, the tool used to evaluate the main real-time metric of the kernel, the scheduling latency, along with the absence of a theoretically-sound description of the in-kernel behavior, sheds some doubts about Linux meriting the real-time adjective. Aiming at clarifying the PREEMPT\_RT Linux scheduling latency, this paper leverages the Thread Synchronization Model of Linux to derive a set of properties and rules defining the Linux kernel behavior from a scheduling perspective. These rules are then leveraged to derive a sound bound to the scheduling latency, considering all the sources of delays occurring in all possible sequences of synchronization events in the kernel. This paper also presents a tracing method, efficient in time and memory overheads, to observe the kernel events needed to define the variables used in the analysis. This results in an easy-to-use tool for deriving reliable scheduling latency bounds that can be used in practice. Finally, an experimental analysis compares the cyclictest and the proposed tool, showing that the proposed method can find sound bounds faster with acceptable overheads.},

Hardware-based programmable logic controllers, while widely used in the industry, do not offer the level of flexibility and scalability required for future applications. Each hardware-based PLC entails costs for maintenance and they cannot keep up with resource-intensive loads, such as artificial intelligence. The virtualization of PLCs promises to solve these issues. A Virtual PLC at the local edge level between cloud and industrial assets provides the flexibility and resource capacity needed for modern control applications. In this paper, the concept of virtual PLCs in a COTS server is outlined as a SoftPLC that is running within a virtual machine managed by a hypervisor. In addition, the virtual PLC is implemented and evaluated to determine whether virtual PLCs can satisfy the requirements for specific domains of industrial automation. We compare multiple virtual PLC configurations to a SoftPLC without a hypervisor. Our results indicate that the virtual PLC implementation is on par in terms of switching and response time for applications requiring response times below 10 ms and deterministic behavior is achievable. While further work is necessary, virtual PLCs may offer tremendous advantages for future industrial systems.},

We investigated how timer hardware is shared among heavily CPU- and I/O-bound tasks on a virtualized OS as well as on bare OS. By replacing the invoked timing methods within a well-known application for estimation of available path bandwidth, we provide the analysis of their impact on estimation accuracy. We show that timer overhead and precision are crucial for high-performance network applications, and low-precision timing methods usage, e.g., the delays and overheads issued by virtualization result in the degradation of the virtual environment. Furthermore, in this paper, we provide confirmation that, by using the methods we intentionally developed for both precise timing operations and AvB estimation, it is possible to overcome the inefficiency of standard time-related operations and overhead that comes with the virtualization. The impacts of negative virtualization factors were investigated in five different environments to define the most optimal virtual environment for high-speed network applications.},

Such combination has the potential to provide a large application base, and to guarantee timely deterministic response to real-time applications, yet there remain some issues, such as responsiveness of RTOS running on top of a virtual machine (VM), system performance and CPU resource utilization rate, etc. In this paper we propose an embedded real-time virtualization architecture based on Kernel-Based Virtual Machine (KVM), in which VxWorks and Linux are combined together. We then analyze and evaluate how KVM influences the interrupt-response times of VxWorks as a guest operating system. By applying several real-time performance tuning methods on the host Linux, we will show that sub-millisecond interrupt response latency can be achieved on the guest VxWorks. Furthermore, we also find out that prioritization tuning results in waste of CPU resources when RTOS is not executing real-time tasks, so we design a dynamic scheduling mechanism  co-scheduling to improve system performance. Experimental results with SPEC2000 and bonnie 1.4 load, show that this new architecture tuned by CPU shielding, prioritization and co-scheduling, can achieve better real-time responsiveness and system performance.},

  abstract = {Techniques for hardware virtualization have been successfully used to provide hardware-independent services and increase isolation between applications in the desktop domain. However, these characteristics make hardware virtualization also interesting for other domains like those involving control tasks. Since these techniques were initially not conceived for this kind of environments where, in particular, timing constraints must be guaranteed, it is necessary to analyze their behavior and investigate the viability of possible solutions based on them. In this paper, we are concerned with using VMs (Virtual Machines) to provide real-time services in the context of automotive control applications. For this purpose, we make use of the Xen hypervisor to design a real-time control loop on the top of a virtualization layer. We first analyze a typical Xen configuration and identify problems that arise when it is used for real-time applications. We show that the worst-case performance of Xen's standard SEDF scheduler (Simple Earliest Deadline First) can be improved by incorporating some minimal modifications. In addition, in order to reduce latency and jitter in a real-time control loop, we propose a new scheduler for the Xen hypervisor that uses the concept of a real-time VM. Real-time VMs are then scheduled before any other VM and under a fixed-priority policy. The proposed VM-based solution is shown to guarantee timing constraints typically encountered in automotive control applications. We further illustrate this through an extensive set of experiments.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, there is a need to introduce a significant degree of flexibility, security and resilience in automation infrastructures, while keeping up with real-time requirements that are characteristic of such domains. Interestingly, many of these driving principles are the same that encouraged the adoption of virtualization technologies on the IT domain, somehow suggesting that the same benefits could be realisable for Industrial and Automation Control Systems, allowing to virtualise servers and cyber--physical system control devices. However, the suitability of using off-the-shelf hypervisor technologies to address the specific real-time requirements of automation infrastructures remains unclear, due to their focus on maximising systems throughput and capacity, often at the expense of determinism and increased latency.},

  abstract = {The increasing functional and nonfunctional requirements of real-time applications, the advent of mixed criticality computing, and the necessity of reducing costs are leading to an increase in the interest for employing COTS hardware in real-time domains. In this scenario, the Linux kernel is emerging as a valuable solution on the software side, thanks to the rich support for hardware devices and peripherals, along with a well-established programming environment. However, Linux has been developed as a general-purpose operating system, followed by several approaches to introduce actual real-time capabilities in the kernel. Among these, the PREEMPT\_RT patch, developed by the kernel maintainers, has the goal to increase the predictability and reduce the latencies of the kernel directly modifying the existent kernel code. This article aims at providing a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches for building real-time Linux-based systems, with a focus on PREEMPT\_RT, its evolution, and the challenges that should be addressed in order to move PREEMPT\_RT one step ahead. Finally, we present some applications and use cases that have already benefited from the introduction of this patch.},

  abstract = {Mobile or humanoid robots collect environmental data and reflect back as robotic behaviors via various sensors and actuators. It is crucial this occurs within a specified time. Although real-time flavored Linux has been used to control robot arms and legs for quite a while, it has not been reported much whether the current real-time features in Linux could still meet this requirement for a much more complicated system - a humanoid with about 60 servo motors and sensors with multiple algorithms such as recognition, decision, and navigation running simultaneously. In this paper, in order to meet such requirement, adopting EtherCAT technology is introduced and its Linux implementation is illustrated. In addition, results of real-time experiments and timing analysis on a multi-core processor are presented showing Linux is a viable solution to be successfully deployed in various robotic systems.},
