My name is Nour Laili and I am currently in the fourth semester of my bachelor degree in Molecular Biotechnology at the FH Campus Wien. As a professional internship is planned for the fifth semester of my studies, I would like to apply for an internship position in your laboratory starting from mid-August for a duration of at least 13 weeks (up to 20 weeks). During this time, I would work 40 hours per week.

On your homepage, I saw that you are very involved in understanding the microbial world and also researching the issue of antibiotic resistance. I find it fascinating that microbiology, pathology, and biochemistry are combined in your laboratory.

In the 3rd semester, I successfully completed the microbiology course. In this course, I learned about the microbial world and among other things, the topic of quorum sensing, which I personally find very interesting, and I would like to learn more about it. Also, during the lecture, I studied a lot about antibiotic resistance (I am attaching an article that we discussed at the FH and that is relevant to this topic). I was so intrigued by the way microorganisms generally survive that I decided to further develop professionally in this area. In the 4th semester, there is another part of microbiology where we will learn more about microorganisms and I also have an exercise where I can apply more of the learned knowledge.

You can find information about my previous career path in my attached resume. I would appreciate it if you could give me the opportunity to introduce myself to you in a personal interview.

Yours sincerely,
Nour LAILI
